# Contains Studio AI Agents

A comprehensive collection of specialized AI agents designed to accelerate and enhance every aspect of rapid development. Each agent is an expert in their domain, ready to be invoked when their expertise is needed.

## Installation

1. **Download this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:otti0815/agent-playground.git
   ```

2. **Copy to your Claude Code agents directory:**
   ```bash
   cp -r agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
   ```
   
   Or manually copy all the agent files to your `~/.claude/agents/` directory.

3. **Restart Claude Code** to load the new agents.

## Quick Start

Agents are automatically available in Claude Code. Simply describe your task and the appropriate agent will be triggered. You can also explicitly request an agent by mentioning their name.

### Example Usage
- "Create a new app for tracking meditation habits" → `rapid-prototyper`
- "What's trending on TikTok that we could build?" → `trend-researcher`
- "Our app reviews are dropping, what's wrong?" → `feedback-synthesizer`
- "Make this loading screen more fun" → `whimsy-injector`

## Best Practices

1. **Let agents work together** - Many tasks benefit from multiple agents
2. **Be specific** - Clear task descriptions help agents perform better
3. **Trust the expertise** - Agents are designed for their specific domains
4. **Iterate quickly** - Agents support the 6-day sprint philosophy

## Technical Details

### Agent Structure
Each agent includes:
- **name**: Unique identifier
- **description**: When to use the agent with examples
- **color**: Visual identification
- **tools**: Specific tools the agent can access
- **System prompt**: Detailed expertise and instructions

### Adding New Agents
